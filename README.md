# TDOSCA-TC14 

**Test-Driven Open Source Compliance Automation Test Case No. 14: a Plain Hello World with external JAVA components, maven, and ambiguous licensing statements**

## Test Case Definition

### Structure

This test case follows the general pattern of a TDOSCA test case:
* It has its own repository [https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/tdosca-tc14-plainhw](https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/tdosca-tc14-plainhw)
* and contains the following parts:
  - **compliance-traps.md**: *describes the traps / challenges implemented by and in the test case* [used to manually control whether a tested compliance tool really overcomes all difficulties]
  - **input-sources**: *contains all sources to create the distributable (binary package)* [used by the tested tool to create the compliance artifacts]
  - **README.md**: *this file*
  - **reference-compliance-artifacts**: *the compliance compliance artifacts a tool (chain) must/should generate*
    - **bom.csv**: *a list of all differently licensed open source components of a package*
    - **oscf.md**: *the open source compliance file* [fulfills the compliance requirements if combined with the distributed source- or binary package]
    - **prerequisites.csv**: *a list of preinstalled tools and libs, required by the software but not delivered as part of the software package*

### Intention

The test data of this test case (the program sources in ``input-sources``)

* can be compiled, installed and used by the respective maven commands
* consist of three java files (*Main.java*, *Greeter.java* and *Tipster.java*) and the respective test classes
* ``Main`` includes ``Greeter`` includes ``Tipster``. Each part says *Hello*
* The main project license is the MIT license, but the classes are licensed deviantly.
* Additionally
  - Greeter uses the external java lib org.joda.time.LocalTime;
  - Main uses the external java lib org.apache.logging.log4j
* The JUnit test are licensed as the classes the test.
* For specific challenges of this test case the [compliance-traps.md](compliance-traps.md)
